        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Don't you wish for death when you're feeling weak!"</p>
            <p>"Hardships aren't as hard as they seem to be!"</p>
            <div class="annotated">
                <div class="annot-passage">
                    <p><span class="annot-highlight">...Sure, say that all you want, you're not fooling me</span></p>
                    <p><span class="annot-highlight">With those words you never mean.</span></p>
                </div>
                <div class="annot-note">
                    <p>Repeated time and time again, these words lose their meaning and become nothing more than hollow reassurances.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>While I don't care to die, I don't mind a bit</p>
            <p>But someone I love? ...God, I think I'd wish I did</p>

                    <p><span class="annot-highlight">I suppose "Because I won't like it"</span></p>
                    <p><span class="annot-highlight">Is all my ego is.</span></p>

                <div class="annot-note">
                    <p>This part reflects on the speaker's motivations and ego. They acknowledge that their reluctance to face the death of a loved one stems from their own discomfort or inability to cope with the emotional pain it would bring. The phrase "because I won't like it" suggests that their ego is unable to handle the emotional distress associated with loss, highlighting a vulnerability or weakness within themselves.</p>

                <div class="annot-passage">
                    <p><span class="annot-highlight">Happy to gaze upon the pain of the haven't-met,</span></p>
                    <p><span class="annot-highlight">Cowering in our hatred has become a fashion trend</span></p>
                </div>
                <div class="annot-note">
                    <p>We don't mind it when we see other people's struggles on the internet because we've been desensitized to these things, and treat these things with a prevalence of hatred and the tendency for people to express it openly, almost as if it's fashionable or trendy.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Even so, we're supposed to "live a peaceful life"?</p>
            <p>Even though I bet it's nice, I bet we've tried.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Someone succumbs behind the colors of the monitor</p>
            <p>Deep in grief, another weeps by singing in their honor</p>
            <p>Hearing that song, a humming young boy wandered</p>
            <p>Off with a knife and an offer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Everybody hated well by life itself, we'll never know</p>
            <p>Why they force code and ego on the radio.</p>
            <p>Day-to-day, they're singing out "I'll take you down",</p>
            <p>But then again,</p>
            <p>Who takes when they're really being generous?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Everybody hated well by life itself, we'll never know</p>
            <p>Why "I want to die" is treated like another joke.</p>
            <p>That world where we see the worth in growing old,</p>
            <p>Anybody hated well by life itself will never know.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Penniless again, through the day anew,</p>
            <p>I decide to praise the lazy and sing out of tune</p>
            <p>Lost upon life's meaning, I take in the truth,</p>
            <p>Breathe and see there isn't anything I'm meant to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Would these wounds be better off expressed</p>
            <p>With the lowly illustration "I'm so lonely" suggests?</p>
            <p>Shouldering nothing but this stubbornness,</p>
            <p>I'm nothing but alone when I go to bed</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Kids with passion to play make-believe will</p>
            <p>Become young adults with a will to achieve.</p>
            <p>As we age, there comes a day we fester like a falling leaf,</p>
            <p>Carried down without a clue to prove we ever breathed...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Breathing on for centuries in a deathless design,</p>
            <p>Bored for eternity, the only to survive...</p>
            <p>...These are the kinds of sci-fi dreams always on my mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Numb to the pain, can I die? Though I'm not afraid,</p>
            <p>All the same, I have to pay attention to the hearts I'd break</p>
            <p>Lost in conflicting thoughts, I'm sure they'd have a lot to say</p>
            <p>Yes, I can guess what they'd convey:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Perfect things need to stay as perfect as they always were."</p>
            <p>"If you can't confront demise, then live the life you don't deserve."</p>
            <p>Since we're bound to end up sad and back to being hurt,</p>
            <p>We should laugh with the friends we lack forever</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Everybody hated well by life itself, we'll never know</p>
            <p>Why we claim to get the happiness we haven't shown.</p>
            <p>Angered by our past hands, past, as we complain aloud,</p>
            <p>We smile while pretending that we're better now</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Everybody hated well by life itself, we'll never know</p>
            <p>Why "So long" took on the meaning of "I wanna go".</p>
            <p>That time where "Goodbye" implied "For now, I hope"</p>
            <p>Anybody hated well by life itself will never know.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Contentment and exits, affection and friendships-</p>
            <p>They're gifts you can get for your money</p>
            <p>...Within but a whimsical fantasy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I could be dead tomorrow, yet I'm sure in some way,</p>
            <p>When I go, I'll get to know my life was such a waste.</p>
            <p>Through daylight and stardom, through springtime and autumn,</p>
            <p>We die everyday, and that's exactly why I chase</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>No wishes or visions; since all I can afford</p>
            <p>Is protecting your life, I ask for that and nothing more.</p>
            <p>Of course... That's surely</p>
            <p>All I'll ever need to sing for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Hated well by life itself, we'll never know</p>
            <p>What makes the meaning matter when we die alone.</p>
            <p>It'll taint you, it'll taint two,</p>
            <p>Soon enough, the rest of us will sink like a leaf into</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Anywhere we know it's not for naught, 'cause we don't stop</p>
            <p>Going out and off, always giving everything we got</p>
            <p>To killing, to kicking, to grinning, to gritting,</p>
            <p>Living, Living,</p>
            <p>Living, Living,</p>
            <p>Living on.</p>

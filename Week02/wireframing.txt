I've had experience wireframing with Figma last semester in Ideation and Prototyping, though I feel like Powerpoint does everything Figma does, so there's that. For a long time I've held the idea of "just go for it" and make it look good on the fly, but I understand now that working with other people, that's not very feasible.
I think I would need to work on asking more specific questions about the wireframe, instead of "does this look good?"
